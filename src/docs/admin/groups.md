# Groups

While a good wiki is one where anyone can contribute new content, it's always a good idea to restrict certain sections and specific actions to a list of selected users.

Wiki.js has a powerful permission system with fine grained control over what your users can see and do.

## Concepts

The permission system of Wiki.js is based on 4 concepts: **Users**, **Groups**, **Rules** and **Permissions**.

A **user** can be part of **one or more** groups.

A **group** defines what the user can see and can do. This is achieved using [**Rules**](#rules) and [**Permissions**](#permissions). 

[**Rules**](#rules) apply to content (e.g. read / write a page, upload assets, write comments, etc.) while [**Permissions**](#permissions) are for administrative tasks (e.g. create users, change site settings, etc.)
